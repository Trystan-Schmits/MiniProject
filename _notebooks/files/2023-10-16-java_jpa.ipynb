    "# What is JPA?\n",
    "\n",
    "JPA, which stands for Java Persistence API, is a specification for persisting data with Java objects. (Persistence means that the object is stored in a database). JPA has multiple implementations, the most popular being Hibernate. Hibernate is an ORM tool. ORM, or Object Relational Mapping, maps a Java object to a database. This allows us to do CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete data) on the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Spring Data JPA and JPA are two different things. Spring Data JPA abstracts JPA. It reduces the amount of boilerplate code that programmers have to write by providing repositories for CRUD operations. This means that SQL knowledge isn't required to work with Spring Boot. However, knowing SQL can help you perform more powerful queries. \n",

    "1. Make sure the terminal window is long enough to view the entire error message. Usually, the most important error message is at the beginning, so you'll want to be able to scroll to the beginning of the message. One of the error messages I encountered while coding looked like this:\n",

I pasted the error message that occurred towards the middle of the output (similar to the the message next to the blue text in the picture) and spent a lot of time trying to figure out what was going on. I couldn't find anything to help me fix the problem, and that was because I was searching for the wrong error. \n",

    "\n",
    "3. Research. Look at StackOverflow posts where people have had similar errors. Usually, you'll learn something new after discovering how to fix the bug. For instance, while researching the error I had, I learned that derived queries were an abstraction for JPQL queries, and I learned about Hibernate and ORM. Researching about JPQL also helped me understand more about SQL. Troubleshooting can be time consuming and requires patience, but the deeper understanding gained after figuring out the solution makes the amount of time spent into it worth it.\n"
