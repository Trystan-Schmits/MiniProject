    "## Issue Recap\n",
    "During the project, I have tried to keep issues to track work and progress.  \n",
    "\n",
    "[Online Issues](https://github.com/jm1021/alienWorld/issues/created_by/jm1021) and suumary below...\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Restructure of Index Files](https://github.com/jm1021/alienWorld/issues/8).   This highlights problems addressed and before and after changes.  Additionally, a big portion of this review document discussess index.html and some of its key challenges.\n",
    "- [Resize Images](https://github.com/jm1021/alienWorld/issues/7).   This is a quick discussion of how I resized my images.   They were large and it was causing characters to slow down.  After resize, things are faster and my eye can not tell the difference.\n",
    "- [Dynamic Screen Resizing](https://github.com/jm1021/alienWorld/issues/6).  Tho figure out how to resize background and characters took a lot of time and a few lines of code that are show.\n",
    "- [ClassIO Diagram](https://github.com/jm1021/alienWorld/issues/3).  This document has worked well to determine objects.  Though, there has been some additions as project continues.  The laregest is managing Game Objects in GameObjectArray.  This is shown in use in index.html in GameLoop and Resizing.\n",
    "- [Migrating to OOP](https://github.com/jm1021/alienWorld/issues/9).  This is a sample and test of scaling index.html to only do background.  This could be a great starting point to using code from this project to migrate your own system."
