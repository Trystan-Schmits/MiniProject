    "### SQL Injection\n",
    "Before you read anything about SQL Injection, make sure you understand everything in the \"Basic Knowledge\" section\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "SQL injection is a type of web application vulnerability that occurs when an attacker maliciously inserts or \"injects\" unauthorized SQL code into a database query. It takes advantage of improper handling of user-supplied input, typically in a web application that interacts with a database using SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confused? Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you want to buy a gift on Amazon and go to this link https://amazon.com/products?category=Gifts\n",
    "\n",
    "This causes the SQL query to retrieve details from the database\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Where\n",
    "- \"*\" = everything\n",
    "- Products = table name\n",
    "- The restricts are that the category is ‘Gifts’ and released is equal to 1 (in this example this means the gift is released)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what if we want to get stuff from the database that isn’t released? How would we bypass the “released=1”?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where SQL injection comes into play! Before we tackle how to do it, let’s go over some syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two dashes (- -) is an SQL comment\n",
    "- \"||\" is concatenate\n",
    "- SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'william' AND password = 'Password1!'\n",
    "    - Stuff between single quotes are strings\n",
    "    - Everything else is an SQL query\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT\n",
    "- A single quote (‘) helps you break out of a string and write more SQL query!\n",
    "- “AND” statement always runs before “OR” statement \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are getting into the good stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How the attack works\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that a login page uses a sql query to search the db if the user and password entered is correct. Remember this syntax: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'william' AND password = 'Password1!'\n",
    "Whatever you enter into the login page will be set as \"username\" and \"password\". My syntax examples has username as 'william' and password as 'Password1!'. Notice how they are between single quotes. Anything between quotes is a string and everything outside of it is a SQL query. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you enter a single quote ' into the login page? Then you will break out of the string and be able to run SQL queries! This is the basis of the two payloads below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- OR Payload: Having an OR statement that is always true\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we enter admin' OR '1'='1' for the username field. Then our sql query will look like this: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'Password1!'\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember how a single quote ' will break out of a string and run sql query commands. We are basically running OR '1'='1' which will obviously always evaulate as true. And since a OR statement will be true if one side of the argument is true, we basically bypass both the username and the password. Thus both fields could be incorrect but we would still be able to login!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Comment Payload: Commenting parts of the query in order to bypass stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember how two dashes (--) is an SQL comment? Well we can abuse this to bypass some info. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can bypass the password by inputting admin'-- in the username box. The sql query would be: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin''-- AND password = 'Password1!'\n",
    "\n",
    "This will lead to the AND password section not being executed. Thus we don't need to input the correct password in order to login. In fact, we don't even need to input a username as sql validates it as an empty string and the whole expression would take the first user. So uh you won't need to have either info.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to protect\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning how the exploits are cool and all but the whole point of this blog is to learn how to protect your website. Here is one way you can protect against sql injections\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries)\n",
    "- Instead of directly embedding user-supplied data in SQL queries, prepared statements use placeholders for the input data. The SQL statement and the input data are sent separately to the database, preventing malicious input from altering the structure of the query.\n",
